<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project allows users to chat with PDFs using an AI similar to ChatGPT, providing personalized and context-aware responses. Unlike traditional PDF readers or AI assistants, this system remembers previous interactions, ensuring a seamless, intelligent, and engaging conversation over multiple queries.

Users can upload PDFs, ask questions, and receive relevant, concise, and accurate answers without needing to rephrase or provide context repeatedly. The AI continuously learns from previous exchanges within a session, making responses more tailored and intuitive.

Built with a focus on usability, efficiency, and scalability, this project is ideal for students, researchers, professionals, and anyone who frequently works with documents. Whether you need quick insights, summaries, explanations, or specific details, this AI-powered tool enhances your workflow and productivity.
